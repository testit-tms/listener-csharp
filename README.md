# Test IT - Listener

The Listener is a program for handling activation requests and passing test runs.
This is a simple example of integration. This should be done automatically in the final version.

To begin:
1. Make your own implementation of the TestRunner class. It should call your project with autotests.
2. Update the variables in the Program class.
3. If necessary, write your own implementation of the TestResultConverter class. Now the class is aimed at reports in trx format.
